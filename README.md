# StreamlitSketchr: Magical Sketches

Welcome to StreamlitSketchr, a project that transforms ordinary images into magical sketches using Streamlit and OpenCV.

## Overview

StreamlitSketchr is a fun project aimed at creating sketch-like representations of images uploaded by users. It utilizes Streamlit, a Python library for building interactive web applications, along with OpenCV for image processing.

## How it Works

1. **Upload Image**: Users can upload their desired image in PNG, JPEG, or JPG format.
2. **Sketch Generation**: The uploaded image is processed using OpenCV to generate a sketch-like representation.
3. **Display Sketch**: The resulting sketch is displayed to the user in the Streamlit app interface.
4. **Download Option**: Users have the option to download the generated sketch as a PNG file.

## Usage

To run the application locally:

1. Install the necessary dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
2. Run the Streamlit app using `streamlit run app.py`.
3. Upload an image and click the "Sketch Me" button to generate the sketch.
4. Optionally, download the generated sketch using the provided download button.

## Note

This project is still in the initial phase and may undergo further improvements and enhancements in the future. It was created for fun and to fine-tune programming skills.
